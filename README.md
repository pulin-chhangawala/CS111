## Introduction
This repository is a comprehensive collection of projects and exercises from my journey through introductory computer science, focusing on Java programming. It includes various fundamental concepts such as Data structure applications, Object-oriented programming, File I/O, Exception Handling, Database manipulation, Recursive solutions and more.

## Features
- **Data Structures**: Applications of foundational data structures using inbuilt Java functionality and the Java.Util library.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to text and CSV files using either scanner or Std.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Database manipulation**: Multiple projects include taking input from .txt or .csv files to feed into databases and later derive relations or probabilities to make predictions.
- **Recursion**: Certain portions of this repository include functions which are recursive by nature to find solutions in a more efficient overall runtime.

## Installation
To access, manipulate and run projects, get a local copy up and running by following these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
  git clone https://github.com/pulin-chhangawala/CS111.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
  cd intro-cs-java

3. **Compile the Java files**
  javac src/*.java

And you are ready to run any projects you want!
